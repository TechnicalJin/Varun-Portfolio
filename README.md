### ℹ️ Screenshot Hosting Tip

To ensure screenshots render properly:

1. Add the images (`Portfolio_Database_Screenshot.png`, `Portfolio_Testing_Postman.png`) directly to the root of your repository.
2. Use this format for the image link:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>/main/<IMAGE_NAME>
```

Example:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechnicalJin/Varun-Portfolio/main/Portfolio_Database_Screenshot.png
```

Make sure the filename is **case-sensitive and correct**.
